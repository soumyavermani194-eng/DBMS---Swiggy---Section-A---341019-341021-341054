Swiggy is a popular online food delivery platform that connects customers with restaurants and
delivery partners through a technology-driven ecosystem. The platform manages a high volume of
users, orders, payments, and logistics operations daily. To support such operations efficiently, a wellstructured and optimized database system is essential.

This project focuses on designing and implementing a relational database for a Swiggy-like system
using MySQL. The database is designed by considering real-world business requirements, data
integrity, normalization, and performance optimization.
